# Developer Experience

There should be a Try Metasphere with code, debugger,...

Maybe it should appear like node, i.e. for the most of the first layer it should feel like its a new javascript framework, but then the submerged side of the iceberg is haskell.

What about different frameworks:
  * Node - npm install -g metasphere-dev ? Should there be metasphere-processing / metasphere-store
  * Meteor - 
  * WebComponents 
  * Angular
  * Elm
  * Purescript
  * Express
  * Backbone
